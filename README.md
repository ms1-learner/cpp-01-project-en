# MS1 Project Guide
A project is a crucial part of the MS1 learning experience that allows you to strengthen your understanding of the content covered in a module by giving you the chance to apply what you've learned to a problem that closely simulates a real-world situation. Some challenges are completed individually, giving you a chance to create a complex program start to finish on your own. Other projects are completed as a group, providing you with a collaborative experience that is similar to working in a real development team.

## Accessing Projects
At the end of each module, youâ€™ll find an instructions page for that module's project. The instructions page will contain a link to the project repository on GitHub. The repository may be a blank placeholder, or may contain some resources you will need to complete the project.

The general link structure will be something like the following:

`https://github.com/ms1-learner/[learning path]-[module number]-project-[locale version]`

For instance:

`https://github.com/ms1-learner/cpp-01-project-ja`

## Working on the Project
Fork the repository link above, make a local clone, and work on the project locally in the same way you work on challenges.

## Submitting your Project
If you are working in a group, only one group member needs to submit the project. Make sure each group member is added as a collaborator to your group's project repository. Coordinate with your group to decide who's GitHub account will host the project and who will submit the project on your group's behalf.

When you are done with your project, make sure the main branch in GitHub is updated with the latest version of your project.

You will need to make a `pull request` in order to submit your project. Don't worry if you have never done this before or don't even know what it is. We will show you exactly how to do this step.

Go to your project repository and click the `Pull requests` tab. Click the `New pull request` button.

On the next screen, check that the `base` repository is the ms1-learner repository and the `head` repository is your repository. Make sure the `main` branch is selected for both repositories. Click `Create repository`.

Add a short description to your pull request if you like and click `Create repository` to finalize your pull request.

You are now done creating the pull request. The next screen will show the details of your pull request. The last step is to copy the URL into MS1. Copy the URL from your pull request in GitHub, navigate to the project page on MS1, paste the link, and click `Submit`.

That's it, all finished! You will be notified on MS1 when your project has been graded. If you do not pass the project, check the pull request for comments from your instructor to find out what you need to change in order to pass. You can access the pull request page from your project GitHub repository. Your instructor will close the pull request after you have passed the project.
